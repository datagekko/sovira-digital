| **Mission**                          | **We elevate momentum brands in fashion and wellness with high-converting, premium Shopify stores – smart-built with AI efficiency and live in just 14 days.**                                                                  |
| Core Purpose                         | Empower €1–1.5 M founders to replace slow, generic shops with lightning-fast, beautiful, _sales-engineered_ storefronts.                                                                                                        |

| Personality                          | Bold · Pragmatic · Aesthetic · Relentlessly Helpful · Performance-obsessed · Human · Reliable                                                                                                                                   |

### Founder Narrative

After a decade inside Shopify builds, our team saw two recurring headaches for founders: **(1) Shopify’s limited native customisation makes every store feel the same, and (2) piling on plugins tanks speed and conversions.** SOVIRA DIGITAL emerged to solve both—delivering bespoke sections without bloat and CRO-ready performance in half the usual time.

## 2 · Voice & Messaging

- **Website** – confident, minimal (“Launch in 14 days. You sell, we create.”)
    
- **Email** – expert yet warm (“Today’s tip to lift CVR 12 %.")
    
- **Social** – punchy (“Themes don’t scale. Systems do.”)
    
- **Client Slack** – direct, proactive (“Dev branch live—feedback by EOD keeps us on the 14-day track.”)
    

Key Hooks: _Fast. Beautiful. Built to Convert._ · _You create, we sell._

#### Language Patterns

**Use:**
- momentum brand
- performance-driven
- lean team
- premium feel
- fast, beautiful, effective
**Avoid:**
- cheap
- basic
- fully automated (no promise of zero effort)
- spiritual/esoteric language
- overuse of jargon (keep it sharp)

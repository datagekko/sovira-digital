Long timelines & high agency minimums
Templated builds that kill their aesthetic
Poor CRO foundations
Limited founder-facing support
€2.5B+ TAM in DTC fashion/wellness brands in EU
Shopify growing rapidly in Europe (CAGR 18.6%)
10k+ EU brands at €500k–3M rev
Increasing need for lean, conversion-first, aesthetic storefronts
Fast execution without sacrificing design
